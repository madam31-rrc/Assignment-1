# Can I explain what my code does?

My project is an HTML-based resume website that presents my personal and professional 
information. The main HTML document, index.html, is structured using semantic HTML 
elements for better accessibility and readability. The project includes sections 
for About Me, Skills, Experience, and Education, along with links to my professional profiles and a contact section.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the components work together:

Header Section: Introduces my name and a brief tagline.

About Section: Provides a short biography and my professional background.

Skills Section: Lists technical and soft skills, each marked with semantic headings.

Work  Experience Section: Details my work experience, highlighting key roles and responsibilities.

Contact Section: Contains links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and an email address, along 
with a professional profile picture.

SVG Graphics: I included an SVG icon to visually represent my skills, ensuring it has 
a descriptive alt attribute for accessibility.

Each section is properly structured to ensure that users and search engines can easily 
navigate through the content.

# What was my coding process?

My coding process followed these key steps:

Planning: I started by outlining the sections I wanted to include in my resume. 
I sketched a basic structure on paper, identifying the main content areas.

Setup: I created the project folder, initialized a Git repository, and made my first 
commit with a basic index.html file.

Building: I worked deligently by focusing on one section at a time. I made a meaningful 
Git commit to track my progress.

Enhancements: After creating the main sections, I added links, images, and SVG 
graphics to enhance the resume.

Validation: I used the W3C Validator to ensure my HTML was error-free and adhered 
to web standards.

Final Review: I carefully reviewed my project for accuracy, functionality, and 
accessibility before pushing the final version to GitHub.

# What challenges did I have?

I faced several challenges during the project:

Using Semantic HTML: At first, I struggled with choosing the correct semantic elements. 
I had to research the appropriate tags to ensure my code was both meaningful and accessible.

Image and SVG Handling: Ensuring that all images and SVG graphics had proper alt 
attributes was a bit tricky. I wanted to make sure the descriptions were clear and useful for screen readers.

Git Commit Practices: Remembering to commit regularly with meaningful messages was 
a learning curve. Initially, I grouped too many changes into one commit, but I improved this as I progressed.

Accessibility: Understanding ARIA roles and ensuring the site was navigable without 
a mouse required extra research and testing.

# What would I do differently now?

Here are the changes I would make if I were to start over:

Plan More Thoroughly: I would spend more time planning the structure and content 
before jumping into the coding process.

Commit More Frequently: While I made a good number of commits, I would aim to 
commit even more frequently, especially after smaller changes.

Improve Accessibility Further: I would dive deeper into accessibility standards 
and test my site with screen readers to ensure a better user experience.

Enhance Content: I would consider adding a portfolio section or references to make 
the resume more comprehensive.
